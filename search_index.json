What is the effect of different levels of historical disturbance on bat species diversity and abundance, community composition? H0: There is no difference in bat species diversity and abundance between forest types summary table - in progress Diversity – Using simpson Estimated richness – accumulation curves raw sp rich raw abundance mixed models on those Whittaker plots NMDS What is the effect of different forest types on vertical stratification of bats in the middle canopy? H0: Net height has no effect on the diversity and abundance of bats captured. - similar to 1) stratified by strata What environmental factors most account for differences in bat species diversity and abundance between forest types? Moon phase, temperature, conopy cover, cloud cover Mixed models e.g. raw richness ~ Moon phase + canopy cover + habitat type + Effort + 1|site H0: The is no difference in effect of environmental factors on bat species d and a Do bats captured in different forest types vary morphologically (don’t know if that is the right word to use. Maybe characters instead?) H0: Bats do not vary morphologically between forest types Response term : forearm length, ear, mass, condition (function mass vs. size) Checkout peig and green’s scaled mass index. Explanatory variables: Forest type Does bat diversity captured via detector differ from bat diversity captured via nets between forest types? H0: Diversity does not differ in forest types from different capture methods. "],

High flying frugivores and low flying frugivores are both strongly represented. Lets test each one against forest type. 3.2.2 High flying frugivores ~ Forest Type SLR seems like it is different… Lets test assumptions ## [1] 42.3 ## [1] 49.7 ## [1] 66 ## Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median) ## Df F value Pr(&gt;F) ## group 2 0.0407 0.9603 ## 12 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1$HFF ## W = 0.8997, p-value = 0.09417 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1[b1$Forest.Type == &quot;CCR&quot;, ]$HFF ## W = 0.8034, p-value = 0.08634 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1[b1$Forest.Type == &quot;PCR&quot;, ]$HFF ## W = 0.75661, p-value = 0.03423 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1[b1$Forest.Type == &quot;SLR&quot;, ]$HFF ## W = 0.92034, p-value = 0.5321 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: aov.hff.resid ## W = 0.93866, p-value = 0.3658 Assumptions are met. ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Forest.Type 2 179.7 89.87 1.706 0.223 ## Residuals 12 632.0 52.67 Not significant, p-value=0.223. I find this curious, it seems like this would have been significant. 3.2.3 Low flying frugivores ~ Forest Type Now lets try LFF. Less distinct trend than HFF. Lets test assumptions: ## [1] 37.5 ## [1] 12.8 ## [1] 102.7 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1$LFF ## W = 0.89037, p-value = 0.06793 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1[b1$Forest.Type == &quot;CCR&quot;, ]$LFF ## W = 0.85055, p-value = 0.1963 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1[b1$Forest.Type == &quot;PCR&quot;, ]$LFF ## W = 0.94265, p-value = 0.6847 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: b1[b1$Forest.Type == &quot;SLR&quot;, ]$LFF ## W = 0.93847, p-value = 0.6552 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: aov.LFF.resid ## W = 0.96034, p-value = 0.6984 Assumptions met. ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Forest.Type 2 120.4 60.2 1.18 0.34 ## Residuals 12 612.0 51.0 Not significant 0.34. 3.2.4 OMG, OMP, ICF ~ Forest Type Lets try the next three highest feeding guilds, OMG (omnivorous nectarivore), OMP (omnivorous predator), ICF (insecti-carnivore). Nothing pops out too much here Lets test assumptions: ## NULL ## NULL ## NULL OMP and OMG violate assumption of normality, while ICG does not. ICG violates normality of residuals however. Nothing significant here. 3.2.5 Richness of feeding guilds ~ Forest Type Interesting, now lets check assumptions: ## NULL ## NULL ## NULL ## NULL ## NULL HFF.rich, LFF.rich meet assumptions. OMG.rich, ICG.rich, OMP.rich violate assumption of normality, I will use a KW test on them. Nothing significant here, although HFF.rich and LFF.rich are close! 3.2.6 Feeding guild variables ~ Combined Forest Type Given the similarities between CCR and PCR in the data so far, I will merge them into a new category, “MXD”, and rerun analyses for all of the previously ran feeding guild tests. 3.2.6.1 Boxplots Some differences seem to emerge. 3.2.6.2 Assumptions: Feeding guild, OMG, ICG, OMP, OMG.Rich, ICG.RICH, OMP.RICH all violate assumptions of normality. I will use a Kruskal-wallis test for these. 3.2.6.3 Results THe number of species of OMG were significantly different between MXD and CCR! 3.3 Hypothesis 3: There is no relationship between Abundances of Individual species and forest type 3.3.1 Identify the most common species Three species are most abundant: C. brevicauda, A. planirostris, and A. lituratus. Lets use these for analysis. 3.3.2 Common species ~ Forest Type 3.3.2.1 Assumptions: All three violate assumption of normality, so I will use a KW test. 3.3.2.2 Results Darn, nothing significant here either. 3.3.3 Common species ~ Combined Forest Type Given the similarities between CCR and PCR in the data so far, I will merge them into a new category, “MXD”, and rerun analyses for all of the previously ran feeding guild tests. 3.3.3.1 Boxplot Some differences seem to emerge. 3.3.3.2 Assumptions: Only A. lituratus violates normality of residuals, and all violate normality of samples. 3.3.3.3 Results Nothing significant here.
