Richness for the high nets violates equal variances. 4.1.2.3 Results Abundance for Low and Medium nets are significant!! 4.2 Hypothesis 5: No difference between feeding guilds between net heights 4.2.1 FG and 5 most rep feeding guild ~ Forest type 4.2.1.1 Boxplots 4.2.1.2 Assumptions 4.2.1.3 Results OMP in M is significant! 4.2.2 # of Feeding Guilds and 5 most represented feeding guilds ~ Merged Forest type 4.2.2.1 Boxplots 4.2.2.2 Assumptions 4.2.2.3 Results 4.3 Hypothesis 6: No difference between feeding guilds between net heights 4.3.1 Common species by net height ~ Forest Type 4.3.1.1 Boxplots 4.3.1.2 Assumptions 4.3.1.3 Results 4.3.2 Common species by net height ~ Merged Forest Type 4.3.2.1 Boxplots 4.3.2.2 Assumptions 4.3.2.3 Results "]
